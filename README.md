# Spirathon_AR_Traveller_MVP

We have two files:
1. gps.apk
2. portal.apk

Before reaching the destination we show destination and hotel by gps.apk. For now we have made portal of Patan Durbar Square. For testing as first you need to detect surface plane. After detecting, click on the plane where you want to create portal. Finally, you will enjoy the portal from your place. Cool right!!

After reaching the destination, we get GPS location then we give information about place. So, our app will not show any information before reaching destination. For now it is for Patan area. After reaching destination we will see i icon around, after clicking, you will get information in from of text and audio. Also you will see nearby hotels. Hotels room are also shown in portal.

In our final demo these two apks will be combined in a single apk.
Thank you!
