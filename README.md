# Spirathon_AR_Traveller_MVP

We have two files:
1. gps.apk
2. portal.apk

Before reaching the destination we show destination and hotel by gps.apk. For now we have made portal of Patan Durbar Square. For using this app, at first you need to detect surface plane. After detecting, click on the plane where you want to create portal. Finally, you will enjoy the portal from your place. Cool right!!

After reaching the destination, open our app, give your GPS location permission, then we give information about place. So, our app will not show information if you reach around destination. For now it is for Patan area. After reaching destination you will see i icon around, after clicking, you will get information in form of text and audio. Also you will see nearby hotels. Hotels room are also shown in portal.

In our final demo these two apks will be combined in a single apk.
PS: Please prefer demo video sent in mail.
Thank you!
